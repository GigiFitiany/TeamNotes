## Project Description

Creating a word-guess-game web component that follows a set of rules established by the multiple clones that exist (some allow infinite guessing, some a limited amount, some let you pick a new word, etc) but this must have a well defined set of rules that I agree to.
Make a microservice on vercel that picks a word at random for the user to play
